    <div class="post"><p>I’ve already written my first wall of text to my manager. It only took one month, and I had several pages of ideas to share with him. I wasn’t sure the best way to communicate them, and some baggage from previous jobs was beginning to resurface–causing unneeded and unwanted frustration. We’re in crunch-time at Wanelo working on some really amazing new features, and I haven’t been able to do the platform work that I had hoped to do. I sent the wall of text to Kig (my manager), and not 15 minutes later he walked over to my desk and asked me if I wanted to go for a walk.</p>
