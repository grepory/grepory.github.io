<p>I’ve already written my first wall of text to my manager. It only took one month, and I had several pages of ideas to share with him. I wasn’t sure the best way to communicate them, and some baggage from previous jobs was beginning to resurface–causing unneeded and unwanted frustration. We’re in crunch-time at Wanelo working on some really amazing new features, and I haven’t been able to do the platform work that I had hoped to do. I sent the wall of text to Kig (my manager), and not 15 minutes later he walked over to my desk and asked me if I wanted to go for a walk.</p>

<p>This was my first 1-on-1 since joining Wanelo. I was terrified, because I wasn’t sure how the e-mail would be received. I had convinced myself that I would be ignored–as has happened at all of my previous jobs. I expected him to mention the ideas in maybe the first and (MAYBE) second paragraphs of the message. I was in for a surprise. We walked for almost 30 minutes, and he touched on every point I made in the e-mail. Some ideas he liked. Some he said he would be hard sold on, and I agreed with his assessments completely. What surprised me the most, however, was his concern.</p>

<p>“Tell me if I’m wrong, but I read the e-mail, and it seemed like there was a tone of frustration in it, and that has me very worried.”</p>

<p>I was actually speechless for a moment. I did not mean for the frustration to show in the e-mail, but as my best friend Faye would say: “Greg, you wear your heart on your sleeve.” I <em>was</em> frustrated; I just hadn’t realized how badly. You see, he’s trying to build a specific kind of culture at Wanelo. There’s no shouting. There’s as little emotional involvement as possible, actually. It’s relaxed. The site is down in production? Okay, well let’s get it back up as quickly and efficiently as we can, but I mean… it’s just a website. We have 99.99% uptime without the obsession.</p>

<p>I was frustrated, because I thought I was being marginalized. I thought I my value at Wanelo was being lessened by the fact that I was previously “an ops person.” The problem with this line of thinking is that I hadn’t <em>really</em> spoken up. I was too concerned that people would think less of me if I called their technical decisions into question. I was afraid that people would hear my advice, and dismiss it, because that’s what had always happened at the past. I spent my first month at Wanelo basically worrying that it was like every other job I’d ever had.</p>

<p>It is, in a sense. It’s a job. It has good and bad things about it. That being said, it is so very different than everything else I’ve ever done. </p>
