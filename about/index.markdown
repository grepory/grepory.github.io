I am an operatically trained vocalist who has performed with the Atlanta Opera
and Santa Fe Symphony. I take hip-hop classes at City Dance Center and the
Little Mermaid singalong at the Castro Theatre is the highlight of my time here
in San Francisco. I love brussel sprouts, bow ties and my spirit animal
bradypus variegatus, the brown-throated three-toed sloth.
